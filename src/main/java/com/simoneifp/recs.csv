How often [[HESHETHEY]] should be seen should be determined by family and the medical provider.  A follow-up appointment can be made by calling Kirch Developmental Services Center at 585-275-2986."""
Developmental Pediatrics Appointment.,on-going monitoring complex case,false,MEDICAL,"""[[FNAME]] presents with more than one potential developmental issue and testing today is somewhat mixed.  In order to monitor [[FNAME]]'s ***, I would recommend that [[FNAME]] continue to be followed by a developmental medical provider who has experience working with children with ***. I believe it would be helpful to get a second “eyes on” from another Kirch staff member for a second opinion.  It is not necessary to repeat today's testing at that time."""

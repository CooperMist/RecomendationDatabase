Monitoring and Intervention for ADHD.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""At present, [[FNAME]]ï¿½s ADHD symptoms appear to be interfering with [[HIS]] functioning at school and at home. Considering the potential for symptoms to negatively impact functioning in the future, we recommend that the family seek individualized treatment to target specific areas of need. For [[FNAME]], this may incorporate the following elements: 

Coordination with Specialists. The family was encouraged to discuss this report with their primary care provider, therapist, and other specialists involved in monitoring behavior.
Behavioral Intervention and Parent Training. Based on observation and parent report, [[FNAME]] demonstrates improved focus and is more successful in the context of structured activities (e.g., classroom). This can be difficult for families, as children with this profile often display more prominent symptoms at home, as compared to at school. As such, for many families, we recommend working with a psychologist or psychiatrist who can coordinate behavioral strategies at home to help address symptoms of ADHD. This professional should involve [[FNAME]]ï¿½s parents both in the identification of therapy goals and in the implementation of behavioral intervention, to ensure consistency of treatment strategies across settings. 
Social Skills Groups. Considering [[FNAME]]ï¿½s difficulties sustaining appropriate peer interactions and developing friendships, [[HE]] may benefit from participation in social skills groups. Group-based learning would be especially suited for [[FNAME]], as it provides ongoing learning opportunities and takes advantage of [[HIS]] inherent social motivation. Ideally, these groups should teach concrete rules for social interaction and include a combination of direct instruction and practice. 
Medication Consultation. Many children show significant ADHD symptom improvement in response to consistent behavioral intervention. Others may show some improvement, but continue to present with clinically significant symptoms over time. As such, [[FNAME]]ï¿½s family may wish to consider consulting with [[HIS]] pediatrician to explore the potential role of medication in addressing [[FNAME]]ï¿½s ADHD symptoms. Ongoing monitoring of [[FNAME]]ï¿½s behavior at home and school, both on and off medication, is strongly recommended to comprehensively evaluate medication benefits and potential side effects. In addition, frequent communication among the prescribing physician, [[FNAME]]ï¿½s family, and school staff, is recommended.

Controlled studies have shown that doses of 0.5- 6.0 mg given 30-60 minutes before bedtime can help children with autism and other developmental disabilities fall asleep more quickly.  Extended Release, (also called Controlled Release) melatonin swallow capsules may reduce night waking.  If chosen as a treatment, sleep patterns should be monitored, and a product without other vitamins or added supplement ingredients is recommended.

"""
Intervention for Hand Mannerisms.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""[[FNAME]] engages in motor hand mannerisms that have the potential to impact [[HIS]] social functioning, particularly as [[HE]] gets older. If this continues to be a concern for [[FNAME]]ï¿½s family, we recommend an intervention plan to address these behaviors, which may include the following elements:

Self-monitoring and reinforcement program. For many children, self-monitoring is the first step toward helping them decrease their target behavior. To increase [[FNAME]]ï¿½s awareness of [[HIS]] repetitive hand mannerisms, a reinforcement program should be implemented where both [[FNAME]] and an adult (e.g., parent, school personnel) keep track of each time [[FNAME]] engages in the behavior. If the frequency of [[FNAME]]ï¿½s hand movements falls below a pre-set criterion, [[HE]] receives points, which can then be exchanged for a reward. This criterion should be determined by [[FNAME]]ï¿½s initial rate of behavior and then lowered over time. For example, if [[FNAME]] initially uses hand mannerisms 5 times per hour, the criterion should be set at 6 times per hour (to ensure success and help [[FNAME]] gain momentum), and then faded incrementally 
Redirection to an incompatible response. [[FNAME]] should be taught a variety of behaviors that are incompatible with motor movements, such as putting [[HIS]] hands in [[HIS]] pockets and clasping [[HIS]] hands in [[HIS]] lap. [[FNAME]] would likely benefit from visual cues (e.g., a card on [[HIS]] desk that says ï¿½hands down,ï¿½ colored bracelets on [[HIS]] wrists) and gestural reminders (e.g., the teacher putting her hands together) to redirect [[HIM]] to a more appropriate behavior 
Competing items. Children with motor behaviors often benefit from the provision of a physical object (e.g., stress ball, silly putty) that competes with the mannerisms. Consider giving [[FNAME]] access to these types of objects in class, for transitions (e.g., walking in the hall), and when [[HE]] is out in the community, as well as during times when [[HE]] is most likely to engage in the behavior, such as when [[HE]] is excited or anxious
Scheduled time to engage in stereotypy. As it is often difficult to completely eliminate motor mannerisms, [[FNAME]] would benefit from the provision of specific times and/or places (e.g., [[HIS]] bedroom) in which [[HE]] is permitted to engage in these movements. In school, [[HIS]] teachers may consider giving him a ï¿½hall pass,ï¿½ which [[HE]] can use to take a walk or go to the bathroom

"""
Ongoing Therapy.,continue therapy,,MEDICAL,"""I recommend ongoing therapy with [[FNAME]]ï¿½s current provider. Based on todayï¿½s evaluation [[FNAME]] meets criteria for ***, but there are additional diagnostic questions that deserve ongoing monitoring.  These behaviors deserve further observation over time.  Therapeutically, [[FNAME]] would likely continue to benefit from behavioral and cognitive behavioral approaches aimed at increasing [[FNAME]]'s behavioral flexibility, tolerance for others breaking rules and getting in their space.  [[HE]] would also likely benefit from social skills training to improve interactions with peers."""
Individual Therapy.,start therapy,,MEDICAL,"""I encourage [[FNAME]]ï¿½s family to seek behavioral/mental health treatment for [[HIM]] as well.  While medication can be a helpful adjunct to treatment, it does not explicitly teach a child alternate and more appropriate behavior, nor does it help parents with managing behavior problems they have to deal with on a regular basis. Working with an individual therapist can help children to recognize and respond to emotions in a productive way.  [[FNAME]]ï¿½s {parent/caregiver:28140} can learn strategies to support their child's emotional development and behavioral strategies to reduce negative behaviors. Strategies to identify a child therapist include:


A. Contacting the family insurance provider to determine in-network therapists
B.  Utilizing web-based resources available through the family insurance plan or publicly available (ie. Http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php) to search for local therapists with the needed experience.
C.  Meeting with, and interviewing several therapists to find a ""good fit.""

Anxiety Evaluation and Intervention.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""During the evaluation, [[FNAME]] and [[HIS]] caregivers reported that [[HE]] experiences various symptoms of anxiety, including ***. Considering [[FNAME]]ï¿½s distress in these situations and the potential for anxiety to negatively impact the functioning of [[HIS]] family and [[HIM]], a comprehensive psychological evaluation is recommended at this time. This evaluation should further explicate the nature and severity of [[FNAME]]ï¿½s anxiety-related symptoms, including identifying situations in which anxiety is likely to occur and the extent to which these symptoms interfere with [[HIS]] functioning. The results of this evaluation should be used to inform a treatment approach and intervention goals. For example, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is an individualized, skill-based approach for treating anxiety disorders and other difficulties.
"""
Evaluation and Intervention for Mood.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""Given [[FNAME]]'s significant emotional dysregulation (i.e., angry outbursts, mood swings, aggression), more mood-specific psychological evaluation is indicated to determine the nature and severity of [[HIS]] mood disturbance.

Some suggestions are provided here that could be incorporated into [[HIS]] treatment plan and/or used at home."""
Instruction in Emotion Identification and Coping Skills.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""Direct instruction in emotion identification, including the use of visual supports (e.g., a feelings thermometer)
Teaching concrete strategies for managing negative emotions in the moment (e.g., relaxation training, coping thoughts).

Frustration Tolerance Program.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""This type of program is recommended to promote frustration tolerance through incremental changes and positive reinforcement and should be highly individualized and systematic.   

A reinforcement system chould be implemented, through which [[FNAME]] tracks [[HIS]] behavior (e.g., outbursts, task refusal) with help from adults and receives praise and external reinforcement (e.g., preferred activities) for tolerating frustrating situations.
Initially, [[FNAME]] should be exposed to low-frustration situations (e.g., easy tasks, small change in his routine) and should be highly reinforced for tolerating those situations.
When the first step has been established, the goal shifts to tolerating increasingly frustrating situations (e.g., difficult demands, going somewhere [[HE]] is not expecting), with accompanying reinforcement. These goals could be targeted both in therapy and also in naturalistic settings (e.g., home, community)
"""
Strategies to improve transitions.,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""Keep [[FNAME]]ï¿½s schedule consistent and use visual supports (e.g., activity schedules) to prepare [[HIM]] for [[HIS]] day. These schedules can also be used to provide a visual warning for when [[HE]] will transition between settings.
Provide warnings before transitions and use timers to signal the amount of time [[HE]] has left during preferred activities.
[[FNAME]] would benefit from clearly and consistent expectations among [[HIS]] environments, including similar responsibilities (e.g., clearing his plate, dressing himself) and similar expectations for what [[HE]] will do with assistance and what [[HE]] should do independently.
Intersperse easy and difficult demands to reduce [[NAME]]'s refusal to follow directions. For example [[HE]] may first be asked to bring [[HIS]] plate to the sink before being asked to clean up [[HIS]] toys.
Maintaining a calm environment (or providing [[HIM]] a secure space to calm down) may help alleviate transition-related stress.
Implement a reward chart, wherein [[FNAME]] receives points or stickers for following directions. These points can then be exchanged for toys or privileges (e.g., extra TV time, favorite dinner).
"""
Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT).,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""[[FNAME]] would likely benefit from participation in regular therapy sessions focused on the development of coping skills, social problem solving, and building up a tolerance for when things do not go as planned. 


Concrete thinking and behavioral rigidity often interfere in [[FNAME]]ï¿½s daily life, at home and could presumably interfere more at school as social and organizational demands become more complex. This could increasingly interfere with [[HIS]] ability to function in social and academic settings. [[FNAME]]ï¿½s {parent/caregiver:28140} understand [[FNAME]] well and provide [[HIM]] with a great deal of support with how to cope with changes. They also provide [[FNAME]] with advanced warning about changes, so that [[HE]] can prepare for situations on the horizon. Although [[FNAME]]ï¿½s {parent/caregiver:28140}ï¿½ support is helpful and instrumental in [[HIS]] success, [[FNAME]] will need to internalize these coping skills so that [[HE]] can enlist them without prompting from others. 

CBT is a type of therapy that is designed to help improve a child's moods, anxiety, and behavior by examining confused or distorted patterns of thinking. Therapy sessions tend to be structured. The therapist teaches the child that thoughts cause feelings and moods, which in turn can influence behavior. One of the goals of CBT is to teach the child to identify harmful thought patterns that lead to depressed mood or anxious feelings. The therapist then helps the child replace this thinking with thoughts that result in more appropriate feelings and behaviors. Research shows that CBT can be effective in treating a wide range of conditions, especially symptoms of anxiety and depression. 
I recommended the family consider cognitive-behavioral therapy for treatment related to [[FNAME]]ï¿½s symptoms of [anxiety and rigid thinking and patterns of behavior, ***]. 

CBT is a specific type of individual therapy. It is evidence-based treatment for anxiety that looks at the relationships between thoughts, feelings, and behavior. A CBT therapist may use techniques such as coping strategies, relaxation, and biofeedback training. Strategies for identifying a child CBT therapist include: 

Contacting the family insurance provider to determine in-network therapists
Utilizing web-based resources available through the family insurance plan or publicly available (i.e., http://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/prof_search.php) to search for local therapists who are trained in CBT.

Social stories allow for direct teaching of social knowledge that some students do not acquire incidentally.  Comic strip conversations are a vehicle for exploring problem solving as well as scripting language for specific circumstances/occasions.  A member of [[FNAME]]'s team (e.g., psychologist, speech language pathologist, special education teacher) can be identified as a ""point person"" for developing, teaching and rehearsing the social stories.

General Accommodations to Increase Attention.,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""I would also recommend academic accommodations to support appropriate attention during group instruction, such as:

Preferential seating to help decrease distractions and to accommodate [[HIS]] auditory processing differences.
Repetition of information to enhance encoding and memory of information. Efforts should be made to create an educational environment that is open to requests for repetition of directions.  
[[FNAME]] will likely require structure, consistent adult attention, redirection, encouragement and praise in order to stay on task and perform at [[HIS]] maximal level. 
It could be helpful to work with a behavior specialist to implement a consistent behavior management plan that reinforces attention to task and work completion.
"""
Classroom Strategies Related to ADHD.,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""[[FNAME]]’s parents reported several symptoms of ADHD (i.e., distractibility, problems with sustained attention, restlessness, impulsivity), which were most prominent during unstructured situations. Given these difficulties, the following recommendations are provided to help set [[FNAME]] up for success in the classroom and at home. Many of these strategies may already be implemented by classroom staff.

Obtain [[FNAME]]’s eye contact before providing verbal directions 
Use visual checklists for complex and long-term assignments, both to ensure that [[FNAME]] attends to the rules of the assignment and to promote self-monitoring skills
Visual supports (e.g., checklists, graphic organizers, activity schedules) for classroom assignments, homework, and materials (e.g., worksheets, books, calculator) will help promote [[FNAME]]’s time-management and task organization skills. 
Color-coded folders, binders, book covers and bins (e.g., organized by subject) will also be helpful in facilitating [[FNAME]]’s organization of important assignments, handouts, and materials. 
Promote [[FNAME]]’s academic organization and home-based adaptive skills through the use of visual checklists for classroom assignments (particularly complex or long-term projects), personal care routines, and household chores. Complex or multi-step tasks should be broken up into step-by-step components, which [[FNAME]] will check off. Initially, [[FNAME]] may complete these checklists with guidance from [[HIS]] parents and teachers, which can be faded out over time and as [[HE]] becomes more successful in managing [[HIS]] own time and responsibilities. 
Visual checklists and activity schedules will be especially important for helping [[FNAME]] understand behavioral and social expectations during unstructured activities (e.g., lunch, recess). Aim to make these activities as structured as possible to help [[FNAME]] organize [[HIS]] times. For example, [[HE]] may use a personal checklist that outlines the rules of the game to be played
Use chunked instruction, in which information and assignments are broken up into step-by-step components and presented individually. Initially, [[FNAME]] should be encouraged to complete checklists outlining these steps with guidance from a teacher; this support can be faded out over time as [[FNAME]] becomes more successful in managing [[HIS]] own time and responsibilities
Conduct comprehension checks to ensure that [[FNAME]] has paid attention to all the key issues and task expectations
Provide verbal praise for following directions and especially for initiating or completing tasks independently
To provide incentive for appropriate behavior and independent adaptive skills, consider implementing a reward system, through which [[FNAME]] earns points for appropriate behavior (e.g., getting dressed in the morning, completing a list of chores at home, following classroom or house rules). These points may then be traded in for a predetermined reward (e.g., extra recess time, five minutes of a preferred activity). 
Despite [[FNAME]]’s low frustration tolerance in the face of challenging task and language demands, [[HE]] responded well when presented with simple, clear instructions and verbal encouragement. These strategies may help facilitate persistence during difficult tasks at home and at school. Additionally, providing him with initial opportunities to succeed (e.g., with easier items or with help from a teacher) before presenting more difficult items will likely foster [[HIS]] momentum to work and will help increase engagement
Allow preferential seating (e.g., at the front of the class, away from doors and windows) to reduce distractions in the classroom
Provide movement breaks throughout the day, during which [[FNAME]] can get up from [[HIS]] seat. To minimize disruption, these breaks can be incorporated into daily classroom activities (e.g., taking the attendance log to the office, watering the plants)
[[FNAME]]’s teachers have reportedly done an excellent job maintaining regular communication with [[HIS]] parents. We recommend that ongoing communication continue, either over the phone or via a notebook or email. Check-ins on a weekly basis will be essential for adequate monitoring of [[HIS]] ADHD symptoms across settings
"""
ADHD Assessment.,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""I provided [[FNAME]]'s {parent/caregiver:28140} with a hard copy of the Vanderbilt ADHD Diagnostic Teacher Rating Scale. I recommended that [[FNAME]]'s {parent/caregiver:28140} give this assessment to one of [[FNAME]]'s school team members in order to help confirm or rule out the possibility of an ADHD diagnosis. The Vanderbilt scale can be found at the following website. 

It is free and available for use by school personnel and healthcare professionals: http://www.brightfutures.org/mentalhealth/pdf/professionals/bridges/adhd.pdf

Follow-up Autism Assessment:,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""I spoke with [[FNAME]]'s {parent/caregiver:28140} about the importance of obtaining autism-specific information from a member of [[FNAME]]'s school team who knows [[HIM]] well. In order to assist with confirming or ruling out the presence of an autism spectrum disorder, I would like for someone from [[FNAME]]'s school team (preferably, his teacher or counselor) to complete the [***, Asperger Syndrome Diagnostic Scale]. I will obtain a copy of this measure and mail a hard copy of it to [[FNAME]]'s home address; I spoke with [[FNAME]]'s {parent/caregiver:28140} about providing this to a member of his school team to then send back to me at my Kirch mailing address. Receiving information on this measure from a school team member would be a tremendous asset to clarifying his diagnosis."""
Assistive Technology Consultation.,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""The report from [[FNAME]]'s {parent/caregiver:28140} and school team indicate that [[FNAME]] has difficulty with hand-writing. Given [[HIS]] high intellectual and academic abilities, [[FNAME]]'s difficulties with hand-writing may prevent [[HIM]] from conveying the full extent of [[HIS]] knowledge during regular assignments and standardized assessments. I would recommend that an assistive technology consultation be sought out in order to determine an alternative way for [[FNAME]] to provide written responses for school-related work. One resource to consider when seeking an assistive technology consultation could be found here:

"""
School Counseling Support:,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""[[FNAME]] may benefit from regular meetings with a school counselor or psychologist who could help [[HIM]] to utilize coping skills and relaxation techniques in the school setting. These meetings could focus on discussing current sources of anxiety at school and helping [[HIM]] to plan how to use some of the strategies [[HE]] has learned as part of [[HIS]] individual therapy in the community. This may help [[FNAME]] to more effectively modulate [[HIS]] reactions when [[HE]] encounters academic roadblocks or discovers that [[HE]] has made errors in [[HIS]] work.  Over time, a school counselor or psychologist can work to increase [[FNAME]]'s independent initiation of coping and relaxation techniques.  In addition, classroom staff could prompt [[FNAME]] to use these coping and relaxation strategies when [[HE]] appears frustrated or withdrawn. """
Functional Behavioral Assessment:,N/A,,MEDICAL,"""In order to address [[FNAME]]'s difficulties with ***, a Functional Behavioral Assessment (FBA) is recommended.  Such an assessment evaluates behaviors that interfere with learning and should include formal assessment of potential behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to the occurrence of problem behavior.

Some behavioral plans require consequences to occur in response to undesired behaviors.  Consultation from a clinician with expertise in behavioral assessment and intervention in children with developmental disabilities may be necessary given the intensity of the behavioral concerns.  For behavioral plans to be successful, they must be consistently implemented by all of the adults who interact with a child at home and at school.  Some behaviors are also seen at home, so behavioral support to the family to help modify these behaviors may be necessary from sources outside of the school. """
Functional Behavioral Assessment: ,FBA oppositional behavior variant,,EDUCATION,"""To address [[FNAME]]’s difficulties with oppositional behavior, work refusal, and tantrums, a Functional Behavioral Analysis (FBA) is recommended.  Such an assessment evaluates behaviors that interfere with learning and should include formal assessment of potential behavioral and environmental factors that may contribute to the occurrence of problem behavior.

Since [[FNAME]] has also shown an escalation of non-compliance and tantrums at home, behavioral support to the family to help modify these behaviors may be necessary from sources outside of the school."""
Behavioral Supports at School.,N/A,,EDUCATION,"""[[FNAME]]'s family reports that [[HE]] engages in challenging behaviors at school that seem to interfere is [[HIS]] ability to participate in daily activities.  Thus, the school team, may wish to consider using some of the following behavioral approaches in the classroom to improve participation and decrease challenging behaviors: 

Environmental Controls. Consider the classroom environment. Are there environmental triggers that set off specific challenging behaviors (proximity to certain children or activity areas)? If so, consider moving [[FNAME]] to an area of the classroom that minimizes these triggers. In addition, [[FNAME]] would benefit from a desk in a quiet section of the classroom, in order to help decrease distractions. 

Daily Schedule.. [[FNAME]] may also benefit from a regular daily schedule, so that [[HE]] can see what activities come next. It may be helpful to display [[FNAME]]'s activities in a visual schedule, with pictures that depict each activity. 

Reduced Demands at Difficult Times of Day.  There may be a time of day, when [[FNAME]] has more difficulties (such as in the morning or the afternoon). [[HE]] could be provided with fewer academic demands and shorter work periods during that period of the day. 

Break Work into Smaller Chunks.  [[FNAME]] has trouble sustaining long periods of independent desk work and would benefit from modified work assignments.  Breaking work sheets down into smaller parts, providing visual supports such as checklists that help structure multi-step tasks, visual cues to stop and ask for help would be useful.


Preferred Activities Following Non-preferred Tasks. Activities could be differentiated and identified according to preferred and non-preferred status. [[FNAME]]’s schedule should be developed where non-preferred activities are directly followed by preferred activities. 

Classroom Rules. [[FNAME]] would benefit from the establishment of clear, concise classroom rules that are tailored to [[HIS]] specific needs. For example, some behaviors that have interfered with [[FNAME]]’s success in the classroom include ***. It will be important for all team members to agree on the rules before they are presented to [[FNAME]]. Similarly, all team members should become familiar with these rules and prompt [[HIM]] to follow them in a similar manner across settings. 

Reinforcement System. To increase [[FNAME]]'s more adaptive behaviors, such as following the classroom rules, it may be helpful to implement a reward system. A reinforcement system should incorporate [[FNAME]]'s special interests (e.g., ***) and include rewards that are actually attractive and motivating to [[HIM]]. In order for a reinforcement system to work, it must be implemented consistently by all school personnel. In addition, frequent reminders about what [[HE]] is working for and what [[HE]] must do to earn the rewards will increase the likelihood that the system will be effective. 

Contingency Contract [[FNAME]]’s classroom rules and the associated rewards can be presented to [[HIM]] in the form of a Contingency Contract. This is a document that is drafted jointly by the team and [[FNAME]]. It states behavioral expectations for [[FNAME]] and associated rewards should [[HE]] follow the rules. The contract is discussed in a meeting with [[FNAME]], modified and signed by all parties involved (classroom teachers, [[FNAME]], school psychologist, etc). One benefit of a contingency contract is that it gives [[FNAME]] a more active role in [[HIS]] own behavioral progress. It will also show [[HIM]] that the educational team is working together and that all parties are aware of behavioral expectations and agree to implement the plan. 

Development of Coping Strategies. [[FNAME]] would benefit from the instruction in the development and utilization of appropriate coping strategies and relaxation techniques that can be initiated when [[HE]] shows early warning signs indicating frustration and anxiety. This may help [[FNAME]] to more effectively modulate [[HIS]] reactions when [[HE]] encounters academic roadblocks or discovers that [[HE]] has made errors in [[HIS]] work. Over time, the team can work to increase [[FNAME]]’s independent initiation of relaxation techniques. In addition, classroom staff could prompt [[HIM]] to use these coping and relaxation strategies when [[HE]] opts to take a break from lessons. Adults working with [[FNAME]] should be careful not to prompt [[HIM]] to use these skills independently until they have been learned and mastered by [[HIM]]. Assessment of [[FNAME]]’s level of mastery should be a part of the instructional process."""

Safety Recommendations.,N/A,,OTHER,"""Since [[FNAME]] has a history of impulsive behaviors, little understanding of danger and a history of bolting and elopement (running away), preventative safety strategies are recommended.  [[FNAME]]'s parents may wish to consider the following:

Hiring a locksmith to install special childproof locks at a height that is not reachable by [[FNAME]].  Please take into account how high [[FNAME]] can reach when standing on a chair or other pieces of furniture located near the door.
Consider giving [[FNAME]] an identification bracelet or necklace to wear, so that others know what to do if they find [[FNAME]] in the community.  The identification piece should include name, parent and other emergency contact numbers, diagnosis, and whether [[FNAME]] is verbal or nonverbal.  Sites that sell identification jewelry include:

You could also include strategies for basic communication.
Since [[FNAME]] often runs towards water, you may wish to consider enrolling [[HIM]] in a swim class at a local Y or other community organization.  This should not be considered a first line preventative strategy to prevent drowning.  Instead, close supervision, childproof locks, familiarity with the location of pools and ponds in the area are more effective.  The primary goal is to insure that [[FNAME]] is never near water while unsupervised.

"""
Strategies to Promote Peer Relationships.,N/A,,OTHER,"""[[FNAME]] would benefit from direct instruction in social skills, as well as exposure to social situations that both focus on [[HIS]] interests, and include similarly-aged peers who share those interests. This may be accomplished through the following avenues:

Goals related to promoting social engagement should be incorporated into [[FNAME]]’s updated IEP. For example, these goals may include maintaining conversation or play with peers, responding to social approaches, and participating in group games.


Facilitated recess is often effective in promoting peer interactions for children who are overwhelmed during unstructured time, as it promotes organized group play and sets clear expectations for students. Specifically, facilitated recess involves a) pre-selecting and pre-teaching group games to students, b) clearly communicating the rules of play, and c) teacher presence, to monitor student behavior and encourage cooperative play. This approach can be especially useful for children with ASD who are in the regular education environment because it is geared toward the entire class and is therefore less stigmatizing.



Peer mentorship programs are especially helpful in supporting children with social difficulties in the natural environment while teaching appropriate social skills. For [[FNAME]], working with a kid in [[HIS]] class would be ideal. This individual’s role may include ensuring [[FNAME]] is included in group games, helping [[HIM]] sustain conversations with peers (i.e., by asking him direct questions), and providing classroom assignment/homework help as necessary.

In addition to school-based supports, [[FNAME]] would benefit from participation in structured social skills groups, which focus on explicitly teaching the unspoken social rules and provide practice applying those skills. The following groups may be a good fit for [[FNAME]]. This information is provided for parents to investigate further.

AutismUp Boy’s Club: http://autismup.org/classes/boys-club/ 
Center for Social Intelligence: http://www.csi-roc.com/ 
Social Endeavors: http://socialendeavors.net/ 


Structured play dates would involve coordinated, one-on-one interactions between [[FNAME]] and a friend in the context of a time-limited activity. For example, a friend may be invited to bake cupcakes, go to the Science Museum, or play an outdoor game. Parent facilitation of these activities will be important for organizing the interaction and promoting [[FNAME]]’s attention, while the involvement of [[FNAME]]’s interests will help encourage social engagement.  
Continued participation in organized groups (e.g., summer camp) that are based on [[FNAME]]’s interests and strengths will help provide a comfortable environment in which [[HE]] can interact with peers.
Group speech and language sessions can be beneficial for teaching social rules and providing ongoing practice for engaging with peers.
The Lunch Bunch program provides regular opportunities for adult-facilitated conversation among children with a variety of social needs.
"""
Anxiety:,N/A,,OTHER,"""It is normal for children and adolescents to experience some form of anxiety during the course of their development.  However, when worrying becomes constant and begins to interfere with daily activities, this may be a sign of an underlying anxiety disorder.  A childhood anxiety disorder may involve some of the following symptoms: worrying about things before they happen, worrying about the safety of parents and others, refusing to go to school, clinging to parents, frequent stomach aches, headaches, or other physical symptoms, fatigue and irritability, or difficulty sleeping.

[[FNAME]]’s anxiety negatively affects ability to use some already mastered skills.  [[FNAME]]’s {parent/caregiver:28140} is encouraged to speak to their pediatrician about treatment options. Typically, cognitive-behavioral approaches have been found to be highly successful. If behavioral approaches are either unsuccessful or insufficiently successful, pharmacological treatment as an adjunct is helpful as well. However, I recommend use of non-pharmacological treatment first as this is helpful in developing needed skills.

"""
Apraxia:,N/A,,OTHER,"""We discussed Childhood Apraxia of Speech (CAS) as a potential etiology of [[NAME]]'s speech difficulties.  CAS is a motor speech disorder characterized by difficulty with motor planning for speech production.  Children with CAS may have difficulty saying sounds and words because their brain have difficulty planning and coordinating the movements of the lips, tongue, jaw, and other facial muscles.  A child with CAS usually knows what he or she wants to say, but struggles to say it due to difficulty with planning and coordinating the oral motor movements.  Muscle weakness or paralysis is not a characteristic of CAS.  Some children with CAS have little or no functional speech, whereas other children are verbal but have problems with intelligibility.   

Further evaluation with a speech language pathologist with specialized knowledge and experience in CAS has been recommended.  This may be available through the school setting, through our center, or through other specialized speech and language programs in the community.  It is often difficult to accurately diagnose CAS until a child is school age or has developed some speech.  It is important to have an accurate diagnosis, as children with CAS tend to do better with intensive, frequent, and individualized therapy that focuses on planning, sequencing, and coordinating the production of speech.

Recommendations to Address Selective Mutism.,N/A,,OTHER,"""1)	Individual therapy with a child psychologist: I recommend that [[FNAME]] meet with a child psychologist regularly to address [[HER]] selective mutism, with the goal of helping [[HER]] to become more comfortable speaking in a variety of social situations. There are a number of behavioral therapeutic approaches that have been found to be effective for children with selective mutism. They include:

•	Contingency management: Providing positive reinforcement (reward) immediately after [[FNAME]] uses a communicative behavior

•	Shaping: Initially reinforcing non-speech communicative behaviors (e.g., nodding, pointing) to eventually build up to or “shape” verbal communication

•	Stimulus fading: Gradually adding or “fading in” the number of people that [[FNAME]] will speak in front through structured social situations

•	Self-modeling: Creating video and/or audio tapes of [[FNAME]] speaking, then playing them for [[HER]] to allow [[HER]] to gradually become more comfortable with hearing [[HER]] self speak in different situations

•	Systematic desensitization: Gradually exposing [[FNAME]] to successively more anxiety-provoking situations, while simultaneously providing relaxation exercises to help manage anxiety

In addition to these behavioral strategies, a child psychologist can work with [[FNAME]] on improving [[HER]] social and communication skills and on building coping mechanisms for anxiety. Given [[FNAME]]’s reluctance to speak to strangers, it will be important for the therapist to work closely with [[FNAME]]’s parents in creating and implementing an intervention plan. 

2)	Social skills training: In addition to individual psychotherapy, [[FNAME]] may benefit from participation in a social skills group, to help foster social and communication skills within a group social situation with [[HER]] peers.
